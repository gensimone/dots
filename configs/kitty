# -- Scrollback
# Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
# Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
# infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
# recommended as it can slow down performance of the terminal and also
# use large amounts of RAM. Instead, consider using scrollback_pager_history_size.
# Note that on config reload if this is changed it will only affect newly
# created windows, not existing ones.

# The opacity of the scrollback indicator which is a small
# colored rectangle that moves along the right hand side of
# the window as you scroll, indicating what fraction you have
# scrolled. The default is one which means fully opaque, aka visible.
# Set to a value between zero and one to make the indicator less visible.

# Program with which to view scrollback in a new window.
# The scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change it,
# make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences for colors
# and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command line above will be
# replaced by an integer representing which line should be at the top of the screen.
# Similarly CURSOR_LINE and CURSOR_COLUMN will be replaced by the current cursor
# position or set to 0 if there is no cursor, for example, when showing the last
# command output.

# Separate scrollback history size (in MB), used only for browsing the scrollback
# buffer with pager. This separate buffer is not available for interactive
# scrolling but will be piped to the pager program when viewing scrollback buffer
# in a separate window. The current implementation stores the data in UTF-8, so
# approximately 10000 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII,
# unformatted text. A value of zero or less disables this feature. The maximum allowed
# size is 4GB. Note that on config reload if this is changed it will only affect
# newly created windows, not existing ones.
